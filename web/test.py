They found that taking naps re-energizes a person and improves cognitive function. The team also discovered that those who regularly take a nap feel more alert after doing so in the afternoon over those who only nap occasionally.\\n\\nThe study\\u2019s lead author Nicole Lovato wrote in The Conversation that she and her team found that around 50 percent of people report taking a nap at least once a week. She also wrote that another study discovered motor learning significantly enhanced after a short afternoon nap for regular nappers than non-nappers.\\n\\n\\u201cNaps are not only beneficial because they make us feel less sleepy and more alert, but because they improve our cognitive functioning, reaction times, short-term memory and even our mood,\\u201d said Lovato.\\n\\nIn their study, they found that the length of the nap is equivalent to the time you will feel refreshed after waking up. Long naps of one to two hours in the afternoon will result in making you less sleepy and will require less sleep in the evening. However, this will also cause you to fall asleep longer than normal. Thus, Lovato suggested limiting your nap for around one and a half hours if you plan to stay up later than usual or if you do not mind taking more time to fall asleep at bedtime.\\n\\n\\u201cThis is the length of a normal sleep cycle. You will experience deep sleep for about an hour or so followed by light sleep for the last half an hour,\\u201d she said.\\n\\nShe also explained that sleeping for too long and missing the light sleep at the end of a nap will most likely make you feel sluggish and drowsy after waking up. Although, a drowsy feeling after a nap is temporary and will fade away after a while.\\n\\n\\u201cWaking up during light sleep will leave you feeling refreshed and alert. However, waking during deep sleep will not,\\u201d Lovato explained.\\n\\nTherefore, Lovato recommended having a short \\u201cpower\\u201d nap of 10 to 15 minutes as it can greatly enhance alertness, cognitive performance, and mood almost instantly after waking. Moreover, its benefits usually last for a few hours. With power naps, you will not feel sluggish or drowsy after waking up because you do not enter any deep sleep within this short period.

If you are having a hard time to stay awake, taking a short nap at any time can also help you stay alert.\\n\\nMaximizing the benefits of a nap\\n\\nA power nap usually lasts about 10 to 15 minutes. However, sometimes a nap takes longer which results in a drowsy and sluggish feeling.

The unnamed man did not know that a tapeworm was growing inside his intestine because there were no symptoms of having a tapeworm, such as severe abdominal pain. Experts at the Department of Microbiology of Singapore General Hospital believe that the man became infected most likely because of ingesting raw fish.\\n\\n\\u201cThe patient was somewhat appalled when the worm was passed out via the rectum,\\u201d said Hsu Li Yang, an infectious diseases expert at the hospital.\\n\\nHsu shared the details of the 2016 case to elaborate the issue of people being infected with parasites after consuming raw or undercooked seafood. He also explained that the worm was an actual tapeworm because no other human parasite could grow that long.\\n\\n\\u201cThe question is what tapeworm, which will also help answer how the patient had acquired the worm,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nInfections from tapeworm occur after eating the larvae of Diphyllobothrium found in freshwater fish like salmon. Typically, humans get infected from eating sushi or raw fish that has been infected with the worm in its larvae stage. The hatching larvae stick themselves to the wall of the intestines of the fish; then the worms infect the flesh of the fish. As soon as a person gets infected, a tapeworm will grow inside the intestine as long as 15 meters within a few weeks. It can continue to live for years and can remain undetected for weeks or months, as well as release its eggs that infect other body parts of the person. Furthermore, if the larvae start to move to other parts of the body, they can begin to eat away at the liver, eyes, heart, or brain and cause life-threatening conditions. Symptoms of tapeworm infections include fatigue, constipation, and abdominal discomfort, which can be very mild that the victim may not observe anything wrong.\\n\\nConsumption of raw fish in Singapore and all around the world continue to gain attention in the middle of the increasing popularity of sashimi. Cases of tapeworm infections not only increased in more impoverished areas but also in more developed countries.\\n\\nIn California, a man who ate sushi went to the emergency room of Community Regional Medical Center after finding a five and a half feet tapeworm that was \\u201cwiggling out\\u201d as he sat on the toilet, according to another Daily Mail Online report. Dr. Kenny Bahn told this story on the podcast This Won\\u2019t Hurt A Bit. The patient thought at first that his intestines were coming out, but when he started to remove the worm, it started moving. The man reported that he ate raw salmon every day, which most likely caused the infection. (Related: Beware: US salmon may be crawling with Japanese tapeworm, say scientists.)\\n\\nPreventing tapeworm infections\\n\\nTo reduce the risk of getting infected by tapeworms, refrain from eating raw or undercooked pork, beef, or freshwater fish. Prepare meat and fish well and cross-contamination between raw meat or fish and cooked dishes. Wash vegetables and fruits before eating them. Remember to wash hands with soap and water before preparing food, before eating, after using the toilet, and after close contact with animals. Lastly, make sure that the water you drink is clean whenever you travel abroad.\\n\\nIf you\\u2019d like to read more news stories and studies about raw foods, visit RawFood.news.\\n\\nSources include:\\n\\nDailyMail.co.uk 1\\n\\nDailyMail.co.uk 2\\n\\nNHS.uk Why some people don\\u2019t eat sushi: NINE foot tapeworm removed from man\\u2019s rectum in Singapore"}'''
